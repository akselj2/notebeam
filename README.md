# NoteBeam, a M335 project

Notes app with QR Code sharing, persistent note storage, and a recent note widget. Supports an organizational tag.

## Differences to planning

- More classes implemented than planned for. (NoteWidget.java & 2 Classes regarding the recyclerView in MainActivity.java)
- Forgot to implement tags until the last second.

## Linter

run ```./gradlew check``` to check for the following conventions:
1. No method is longer than 30 lines
2. PascalCase for public properties (class names in this case) & camelCase for methods and variables
3. If english is used, but Checkstyle can't do language analysis.
